Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-catalog-assistant.git
cd smart-catalog-assistant


Install DependenciesSince this example uses CDN-hosted libraries, no npm install is required for the frontend. However, ensure you have a local server to serve the files (e.g., http-server or live-server).
npm install -g http-server


Configure Environment VariablesCreate a .env file in the project root with the following variables:
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG='{"apiKey": "your-api-key", "authDomain": "your-auth-domain", "projectId": "your-project-id", "storageBucket": "your-storage-bucket", "messagingSenderId": "your-sender-id", "appId": "your-app-id"}'
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY='your-gemini-api-key'
REACT_APP_INITIAL_AUTH_TOKEN='your-optional-auth-token'


Replace your-api-key, etc., with your Firebase project configuration.
Obtain your-gemini-api-key from the Google Cloud Console.
REACT_APP_INITIAL_AUTH_TOKEN is optional for custom Firebase authentication; omit for anonymous auth.


Run the ApplicationServe the files using a local server:
http-server .

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the port provided by the server).
